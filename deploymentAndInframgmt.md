https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html

AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to define and provision your AWS infrastructure as code. With CloudFormation, you can create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, databases, S3 buckets, IAM roles, and more, in a controlled and predictable manner.

  Reusability: Enables reuse of infrastructure templates for different use cases.
  Version Control: Allows versioning and tracking of infrastructure changes.
  Scalability: Supports scalable deployments and resource management.
  Cost Management: Provides visibility into infrastructure costs for optimization.
  Security and Compliance: Enforces security best practices and compliance requirements.
  Extensibility: Integrates with other AWS services and third-party tools for customization.
