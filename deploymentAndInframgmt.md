## AWS CloudFormation
  AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to define and provision your AWS infrastructure as code. With CloudFormation, you can create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, databases, S3 buckets, IAM roles, and more, in a controlled and predictable manner.
